# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if not detected early.  

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify retinal fundus images and detect signs of diabetic retinopathy automatically.

The goal is to assist ophthalmologists in early diagnosis using AI-based screening.
